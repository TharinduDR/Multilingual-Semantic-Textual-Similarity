# Multilingual Semantic Textual Similarity
Semantic textual similarity (STS) is a natural language processing (NLP) task which quantitatively assesses the semantic similarity between two text snippets. STS is a fundamental NLP task for many text-related applications, including text de-duplication, paraphrase detection, semantic searching, and question answering. Measuring STS is a machine learning (ML) problem, where an ML model predicts a value that represents the similarity of the two input texts.

This project catalogues datasets annotated for semantic textual similarity. Then we present a comparative evaluation of several deep learning based STS methods in these datasets. In this site, we present the datasets and pre-trained models evaluated in Multilingual Semantic Textual Similarity project.

This project is joint work with [Dr Tharindu Ranasinghe](https://tharindu.co.uk/) from the University of Wolverhampton, [Prof Ruslan Mitkov](https://researchers.wlv.ac.uk/R.Mitkov) from the University of Wolverhampton and [Prof Constantin Orăsan](https://dinel.org.uk/) from the University of Surrey.
